### Background
- Born in Italy
- Bachelor of Biotecnology, 2010-2013, University of Rome -Tor Vergata-

### Project
My project aims to explore the contribution of the parents to the early zebrafish embryogenesis, by combining imaging and Next-Generation-Sequencing technologies. Particularly, I am interested in the understanding of mechanisms behind the flow of information through zebrafish generations.

### Secondments
