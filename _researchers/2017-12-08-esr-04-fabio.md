### Project
My project aims to explore the contribution of the parents to the early zebrafish embryogenesis, by combining imaging and Next-Generation-Sequencing technologies. Particularly, I am interested in the understanding of such mechanisms behind the flow of information through zebrafish generations.

### Secondments
Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Münster, October 2016, Juanma Vaquerizas' group
