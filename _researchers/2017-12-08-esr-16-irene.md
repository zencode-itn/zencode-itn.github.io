### Background
-   From New York
-   BSc, Hunter College City University of New York
-   Postbac, NIH
-   Medicine (preclinical), Oradea Medical College

### Project
My research project is focused on genome annotation and high-throughput data analysis. We are building an online database of functional elements and expression data in the Danio Rerio ([danio-code.zfin.org](https://danio-code.zfin.org)). With almost 1000 datasets, 17 assay types (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CAGE-seq etc.) from 38 stages of development, it is meant to be a resource of high-quality genomic data for the zebrafish community.
