ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) is a quite new technique
that allows us to understand how accessible the chromatin is.

No one in my lab new the technique so I decided to learn it from a group that had been using it
for a while, Ferenc Mueller lab. I collected some samples and went there to learn how to do the
technique and then be able to set up the technique in my lab.

I spent two weeks in Birmingham and with the help of Ferenc Mueller and Fabio D'Orazio, I was able
to learn all the steps of the technique and understand better the results I could expect from it.

During my two weeks there I also found time to enjoy Birmingham, that was already ready for Christmas,
and of course I did a day trip to Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeareâ€™s birthplace with my ITN partners
Fabio and Sanjana.
