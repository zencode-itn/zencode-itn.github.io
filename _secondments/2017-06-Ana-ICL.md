Analyzing and integrating the data generated in the lab can be really difficult for 
a wet-lab scientist. 

This is why, taking advantage of being part of a network, I decided to contact Boris 
Lenhard and ask him if I could spend some time in his lab to learn from them.

For a month, I was part of his group. There, with the help of Boris Lenhard, and 
specially, Piotr Balwierz, I could find the best way to analyze my ATAC-seq data and 
compare it with the RNA-seq I had preciously produced.

But, as you can imagine I was not there only to learn bioinformatics, I also found 
time to enjoy London and UK, and even to do some sport!! Have you ever heard about 
rounders? If you havenâ€™t, you can ask Boris babes team, they were the winners of the 
competition organize by the institution.
