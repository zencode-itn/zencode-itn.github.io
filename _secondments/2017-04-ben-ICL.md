Molecular biology is complex.

Disentangling mechanisms underlying
the orchestrated action of thousands of genes,
in hundreds of thousands of cells,
with terabytes of genomic information,
is inherently a hard computational biology problem.

And when it comes to integrating this data into biological hypotheses,
the best would be to have as much help as possible from leading experts in the field.

Even better, if this experience can be firsthand.

Luckily, as one of ZENCODE core assets to me,
I had the opportunity to get such experience
with a research stint at the Lenhard Group of
Computational Regulatory Genomics in Imperial College London.

There, a talented – and collegial – research group,
together with a personal guidance from Alex Nash and Boris Lenhard,
helped me to learn key analytical aspects and thinking frameworks
that were immediatly applied to my research questions.

Half a month passed fast. I learnt scientific hard and soft skills.
And in parallel, I was able to have some fun sightseeing with my hosts!
