  The ZENCODE Initial Training Network aims to improve career perspectives of early-stage researchers (ESR) in both public and private sectors, thereby making research careers more attractive to young people.
  The scientific focus of the ZENCODE-ITN consortium is to understand genome regulation through combined experimental and computational approaches in a model vertebrate.
