<h2> ATC6/7 and Open Day 27th November-1 December 2017, London, UK</h2>
<p>Our 4th training (transferable skills and advanced RNA-seq analysis) was jointly organized and hosted by King's College London and Imperial College London.</p>
<p>A fully packed week with trainings in presentation, video blogging, grant writing, and career talks.</p>

<p>In the middle of the week we ESRs got the opportunity to visit two schools in South London, where we presented different aspects of our research at three workshop stations (sequence similarity between human and zebrafish, translational ressearch using zebrafish, and the different zebrafish stages with a DIY microscope).</p>

<p>The week finished on a more technical note with in depth training of RNA-seq data analysis.</p>

<h2>ATC 4&5 and Mid-Term Review Meeting 11th-13th Jan 2017, Münster, Germany</h2>
<p>Our 3rd training event (ChIP-seq and MedIP-seq analysis; organised by MPI, Imperial) was held in Münster, Germany, hosted by the Max Planck Institute. Arranged over 3 days it also incorporated our Mid-Term Review Meeting where all the ESRs presented updates on their projects, along with some background information for our EU project Officer and reviewer. Social events included a tour of Münster and two evening dinners, all very much enjoyed by our ESRs and PIs.</p>

<h2> ATC2&3 25th April-5th May 2016, Liege, Belgium</h2>

<p>Our second training event ATC2/3 took place at GIGA, University of Liege, Belgum. 14 ZENCODE PhD students, from Japan, Sweden, Germany, England, Spain and Belgium, attended the 2 weeks training course on the CAGE-seq and ChIP-seq technologies. A Network and Supervisory Board meeting was also held on the last day where all students presented updates on their projects so far and plans for the future. It was a great success as demonstrated in the photos below.</p>
