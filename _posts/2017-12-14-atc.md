## ATC6/7 and Open Day 27th November-1 December 2017, London, UK


## ATC 4&5 and Mid-Term Review Meeting 11th-13th Jan 2017, Münster, Germany
Our 3rd training event (ChIP-seq and MedIP-seq analysis; organised by MPI, Imperial) was held in Münster, Germany, hosted by the Max Planck Institute. Arranged over 3 days it also incorporated our Mid-Term Review Meeting where all the ESRs presented updates on their projects, along with some background information for our EU project Officer and reviewer. Social events included a tour of Münster and two evening dinners, all very much enjoyed by our ESRs and PIs.

## ATC2&3 25th April-5th May 2016, Liege, Belgium

Our second training event ATC2/3 took place at the University of GIGA in Liege, Belgum. 14 ZENCODE PhD students, from Japan, Sweden, Germany, England, Spain and Belgium, attended the 2 weeks training course on the CAGE-seq and ChIP-seq technologies. A Network and Supervisory Board meeting was also held on the last day where all students presented updates on their projects so far and plans for the future. It was a great success as demonstrated in the photos below.
