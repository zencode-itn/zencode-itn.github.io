## Final ZENCODE-ITN Meeting, 28th Oct – 31st Oct 2018, Cape Sounio, Greece

The final ZENCODE-ITN Meeting took place in Cape Sounio, Greece on October 28th 2018. The topic was Developmental and medical genomics with animal models.
It was a three-day event that featured talks from 21 invited speakers, as well as student talks and poster sessions (https://sounio.zencode-itn.eu/#program)  
 

A keynote address was delivered by Monte Westerfield of University of Oregon on genetic models of Usher Syndrome using Zebrafish. 

There was a good mix of talks from zebrafish transcriptional regulation (Ferenc Mueller- University of Birmingham) to post-transcriptional regulation (Eivind Valen – University of Bergen) to canine models of disease (Hannes Lohi- University of Helsinki). Among the invited speakers were Paul Flicek (European Bioinformatics Institute), Piero Carnici (RIKEN, Japan) and Albin Sandelin (Copenhagen University). 


Last day of the conference ended with a social trip to the Temple of Poseidon, built circa 440 B.C. 

Perched 60 m above the Aegean Sea, the Best Student Presentation Award was awarded to Benjamín Hernández-Rodríguez (Max Plank Institute for Molecular Biomedicine) and Best Poster Award to Dunja Vucenovic (Imperial College London). 



## Gene-Regulatory Systems in Development 27th-29th March 2017, Carmona, Spain

Our jointly organised conference with fellow ITN project [DevCom](https://www.devcom-itn.eu/) proved a great success. Set in the beautiful town of Carmona, just outside Seville in Spain. It created a beautiful backdrop for an interesting and fruitful conference that all our students were able to attend and take part in the poster session. Invaluable time was spent networking with prominent invited speakers and a session with the editor of Nat Genet was another highlight for our group.
